This is a work in progress. Updates will be commited periodically!

## Description of the data source
This dataset of severe workplace injuries was obtained from U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA). The OHSA requires all employers to report severe workplace injuries, which is defined as an amputation, hospitalization, or loss of an eye. The data set thus contains all reported severe injuries under federal OHSA jurisdiction. 
The data was extracted on Feburary 23, 2025, with the data being reported for incidents taking places from Jan 2015 to April 2024.

## Project goals
1. To examine trends in workplace injuries in the construction industry
2. As we will be comparing injuries by year, only full calender years will be considered in the analysis. Thus, 2024 data (which only covers incidents up to the month of April) will be excluded.
